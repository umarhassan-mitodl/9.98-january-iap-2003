Course Description

This course is designed as a primer for students new to the field of linguistics and psychology. The development of human language as a child grows and the interplay with the mind during language production is contemplated. The course also considers how language changes during the aging process, and the reacquisition of language after a major trauma or operation. Additionally, we will explore cross-cultural language production and how it can be studied with modern scanning techniques in the human brain.

The course will address some fundamental questions regarding human language:

1.  How language is represented in our minds
2.  How language is acquired by children
