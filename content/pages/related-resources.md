Cognition
---------

The [Cognitive Science Society](http://www.cognitivesciencesociety.org/) has the latest news and information on conferences, funding, and employment, along with a host of related conferences.

The [Cognitive Neuroscience Society](http://www.cogneurosociety.org/) is committed to the development of mind and brain research aimed at investigating the psychological, computational, and neuroscientific bases of cognition.

The [American Psychological Society](http://www.psychologicalscience.org/) promotes, protects, and advances the interests of scientifically oriented psychology in research, application, teaching, and the improvement of human welfare.

The [Organization for Human Brain Mapping](http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/) provides an educational forum for the exchange of up-to-the-minute and ground-breaking research across modalities exploring human brain mapping.

The [Psychonomic Society](http://www.psychonomic.org/) promotes the communication of scientific research in psychology and allied sciences.

Linguistics
-----------

The [American Association for Applied Linguistics](http://www.aaal.org/) is a professional organization of scholars who are interested in and actively contribute to the multi-disciplinary field of applied linguistics.

The [American Philological Association](http://www.apaclassics.org/) is the principal learned society for classical studies of ancient Greek and Roman languages, literatures, and civilizations.

The [Association for Computational Linguistics](http://www.aclweb.org/) is an international scientific and professional society for people working on problems involving natural language and computation.

The [Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing](http://www.allc.org/) supports the application of computing in the study of language and literature.

The [Association for Machine Translation in the Americas](http://www.amtaweb.org/) is for those interested in the translation of languages using computers in some way.

The [International Speech Communication Association](http://www.isca-speech.org/) covers all the aspects of speech communication (acoustics, phonetics, phonology, linguistics, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, signal processing, pattern recognition, etc.

[Epigraphic Society](http://www.epigraphy.org/) is concerned with the discovery and decipherment of ancient inscriptions.

The [Linguistic Society of America](http://www.lsadc.org/) serves its members through scholarly meetings, publications, and special activities designed to advance the discipline of linguistics.

The [Philological Society](http://www.philsoc.org.uk/) is devoted to the scholarly study of language and languages.
